# GraphQL Fundamentals

Welcome! You will use this simple app to explore GraphQL, building a schema, querying a REST endpoint and a database, and making queries and mutations available on the client.

## Setup

* Install [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install). You won't need to know anything about Meteor, but it will be running our app behind the scenes.
* `git clone https://github.com/okgrow/graphql-fundamentals.git`
* `cd graphql-fundamentals`
* `meteor npm install`
* `cp settings.example.json settings.json`
* Log into Trello and add your api key and secret to settings.json. You can find that information on [here] (https://trello.com/app-key).
* `meteor npm start`

If all is well, you will see an app called Pomodoros and will be able to log in with Trello. The the app displays your your after login, everything is working.
